# ViorHealth Application Icons

This folder should contain the application icons for the Windows build.

## Required Files:

### For Windows:
- `icon.ico` - Windows application icon (256x256 or higher, .ico format)
- `icon.png` - PNG version for development (512x512 or 1024x1024)

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an online converter
1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG image with your app logo
2. Visit: https://www.icoconverter.com/ or https://redketchup.io/icon-converter
3. Upload your PNG and convert to ICO format (make sure to include multiple sizes: 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256)
4. Download and save as `icon.ico` in this folder

### Option 2: Use a design tool
1. Design your icon in Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or similar
2. Export at 1024x1024 as PNG
3. Use a converter tool to create the ICO file

## Temporary Placeholder
Until you create your custom icons, you can:
1. Use a generic medical/health icon from icon libraries
2. Download from: https://icon-icons.com/ or https://www.flaticon.com/
3. Search for "medical", "healthcare", "hospital", or "health" icons

## Icon Guidelines:
- Use simple, recognizable symbols
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Make sure it looks good at small sizes (16x16)
- Use your brand colors
- Avoid too much detail
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
